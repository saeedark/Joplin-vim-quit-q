# Joplin-vim-quit-q

After installation and finding vim like interface wrong keybinding makes me mad

wanna add :q to exit joplin just like vim ?

it's not keybinding , it's a command ;) 

## Use ?
Simply add ```bash command-q.js``` to  installed location of Joplin node_modules

For example : 
```bash
~/.joplin-bin/lib/node_modules/joplin
```
But wait , It's easier to copy ```bash command-exit.js``` content and put it in ```bash command-q.js``` beside ;))
